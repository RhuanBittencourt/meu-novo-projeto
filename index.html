            <h2>Quebec</h2>
            <div class="quote">Quebec is the second most populous province in Canada, after Ontario. </div>
            <div class="text">It is the only one with a predominantly French-speaking population, with French being the only official language at provincial level. Most residents live in urban areas near the Saint Lawrence River, between Montreal and Quebec City, the capital. Approximately half of the province's residents live in Greater Montreal, including the Island of Montreal. Anglophone communities and English-speaking institutions are concentrated in the west of the island of Montreal, but they are also significantly present in the Outaouais, Oriental Municipalities and Gasp√© regions. The northern region of Quebec, which occupies the northern half of the province, is sparsely populated and inhabited mainly by aboriginal peoples.</div>
